/**
 * What is OOP?
 *
 * We use objects to model real-world or abstract features
 *
 * Object may contain data (properties) and code (methods)
 *
 * 4 principles of OOP:
 * 1. Abstraction -> Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter,
 *  allowing us to get and overview perspective of the thing we're
 *  implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really
 *  matter to our implementation.
 *
 * 2. Encapsulation -> Keeping properties and methods private inside
 *  the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class.
 *  Some methods ca be exposed as a public interface (API)
 *
 * 3. Inheritance -> Child class can inherit methods and properties
 *  prom parent class
 *
 * 4. Polymorphism -> A child class can overwrite a method
 *  it inherited from a parent class.
